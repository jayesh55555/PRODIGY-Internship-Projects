# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and continues until the player guesses the correct number. It also displays the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guess when prompted.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
6. The program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.
